# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    tags:

    branches: [main, zip-and-release]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
